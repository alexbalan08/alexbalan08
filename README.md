👋 Hello, I'm Alex Balan! I'm a passionate and dedicated Data Science and AI student with a keen interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, NLP and other such fields.

🛠️ I have experience working with languages and technologies like JAVA, Python, C++, MathLab, R, Prologue, SQL or Git. 

🎯 I'm currently focused on my Data Science studies, planning to follow a master in the same field. Machine Learning tasks are my main interest, being highly motivated by combining it with Stocks trading systems in the future. 

🌱 I’m on track to learn any new skill, including some web design tools which I find very important for my future interests. Reinforcement Learning is one of my main interests as mentioned above, but there is still a lot of place for improvement and practice.
